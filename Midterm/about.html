                    By now many people know that the Açaí berry is one of the most nutrient dense foods on the planet with a unique combination of protein, healthy oils, fiber, and antioxidants. Most people don’t know how important acai has become in protecting and preserving the Brazilian Amazon as the vast forest faces ever increasing pressure. Acai cultivation provides income for countless families living in the Amazon river basin and a sustainable alternative to the destructive practices of clear cutting, cattle grazing, and mining.
